    <h2 class="about-header">RECRUIT FAMILY MEMBERS</h2>
    Our first goal is to recruit our family members. With any successful
    project, it relies on building a strong community.Our goal is not to sell
    out in record time. Our goal is to ensure our NFTs are minted by the right
    people who share our vision. We will drop a limited supply of NFTs across
    several drops over a period of 6 weeks. Drops will be via application only.

    <h2 class="about-header">COLLECTIVE WEALTH</h2>
    1. An abundance of resources owned by a community As a community, we will
    decide on how to invest the royalties generated from sales on the secondary
    market. We will purchase assets such as NFTs or land in the Metaverse. These
    investments will belong to the family. <br /><br />
    2. Future Projects The Eight Bit Mafia isn’t our final destination. In fact,
    this is just the start! As a community, we will breathe life into new ideas
    and own them together. But if we’re gonna make it, we will need everyone’s
    support.

  <h2 class="about-header">THE METAVERSE</h2>
  Once we feel our community is ready, we will enter the Metaverse. This could
  take 6 months or a year, but once we get there, we will have one of the
  strongest NFT projects in the space. As a community, we will invest in land to
  build our HQ and other Eight Bit Mafia owned businesses. This will be the
  start of our organisation’s transition into the Metaverse.

    Perhaps the most exciting part for us! A first of its kind launchpad for
    aspiring founders to pitch their NFT project ideas. If you've had an idea
    but had no clue on where to start, this is where The Council can help. As a
    holder of our NFTs, you will get access to a community of Metaverse
    Pioneers; Developers, Artists, Entrepreneurs, Traders and Investors. Think
    of your NFT as your membership to a pool of expertise in the future of Web3
    and beyond. You will be able to pitch your idea and get expert feedback from
    The Council and notable guests. The idea is for us to fund and support the
    next big thing! Projects our entire community will benefit from, with
    guaranteed presale spots and exclusive perks for Eight Bit Mafia holders.
